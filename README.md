## [Mac Terminal Setup](mac-terminal)

This is a guide for how to set up your terminal so it looks exactly like mine.
The end result should be this:

## [Mac – Python 3.4](mac-python3)

Install script for python 3 on Mac OS X, for most scientific stuff.

## [Latex Template](latex-template)

A template for LaTeX I have been continuously developing over a few years.

## [DTU HPC – Python 3.4](dtu-hpc-python3)

The Danish Technical University (DTU) have a supercomputer
(see http://www.cc.dtu.dk/). I use this quite extensively for heavy computation
and for just having a platform that all my study friends and supervisors have
access to. Unfortunately it is primarily for C and MatLab, so I have created
an automated setup script for python.

## [DTU HPC – Python 2.7](dtu-hpc-python2)

Similar to [DTU HPC – Python 3.4](dtu-hpc-python3) but for python 2.7. I
no longer maintain this and suggest you use python 3.4.
